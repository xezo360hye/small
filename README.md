# What is this?
This is the repository for my small projects

If you went here from my YouTube channel (most likely), you are at the root of all projects you might want to find

If not, I just don't know what are you doing here. Tho you may discover my programs and send a feedback :>

# How to download <> program?

Every project here is only one file so just copy it or use the command `wget "https://raw.github.com/xezo360hye/small/PROJECT"` (if you want, replace *wget* to *curl* or something else)
